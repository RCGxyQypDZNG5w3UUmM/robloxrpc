# robloxrpc
rpc.py code taken from here: https://github.com/niveshbirangal/discord-rpc<br />
everything else is 100% original and what I slaved over for the past 2 weeks, LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br />

- roadmap
⬜ making it so it detects game changes, maybe by checking placeids and seeing if they match? or a more improved approach?<br />
⬜ making it able to detect when there is no game, and causing a message to be spit out (with expletives cause we cool like that)<br />
⬜ making it launch with roblox and grab the data during startup
